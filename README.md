Hi! I’m Mehmet Ali — someone who genuinely enjoys creating things.
Writing code, learning new ideas, breaking things, fixing them again, and watching an idea slowly turn into something real… that whole process is what keeps me here.

I like keeping my projects honest: simple where they can be, detailed where they need to be, and always driven by curiosity.
Most of the time, I work on whatever teaches me something new — sometimes it becomes a full project, sometimes just a small experiment, but I try to leave every repo with a little improvement compared to where it started.

I use GitHub as a space to think out loud, explore ideas, document what I learn, and grow at my own pace.
If you’re passing by, feel free to look around — you might find something useful, something interesting, or at least something that shows how much I enjoy the craft.

Always happy to meet people who build, learn, and create just for the love of it.
Thanks for being here — and enjoy your stay. 🚀
